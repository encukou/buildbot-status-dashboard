A dashboard to maybe replace https://buildbot.python.org/#/wsgi/release_status

Some files should be copiable directly to the buildbot config:
- `release_dashboard.py`
- `templates/*`
- `static/*`

The rest is scaffolding and hacks to make this a stand-alone app.

A static preview is on GitHub Pages. It does *not* update automatically.



This is a fork of a part of https://github.com/python/buildmaster-config/ and
follows the same licence.
